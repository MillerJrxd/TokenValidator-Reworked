## Installation
   - Download the latest release **TokenValidator-release.zip**
   - Unpack the zip's content to the desired location
   - If you are not sure that you have .NET 9 installed on your machine, run **AppBootstrapper.exe** first, that should install it for you. 
      - *If for any reason it fails to do so, please install it manually from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-9.0.200-windows-x64-installer).*
   - If .NET 9 is already installed on your machine just run the **TokenValidator.exe** and you should be good to go.
